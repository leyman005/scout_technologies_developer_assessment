# scout_technologies_developer_assessment
Create a fully functional CRUD for user

I have completed the assessment using laravel

You will need to clone my git repository, create a database, the database name is located in the .env file,
run the migration command then you will have my tables in your local database.

Then you will be able to test my codes
